Color Contrast Analyser for WCAG 2.0 compliance

The extension allows you to pick colors from a web site and test the contrast compliance with WCAG 2.0.

A color picker with a magnifier glass facilitates the correct selection of the desired pixel, and even averages multiple pixels.

Picked colors shows in the toolbar as background or foreground of text. 

The tool bar evaluates and displays the contrast and the success criteria.

The toolbar menu offers choices for 10 challenged visions and some effects.

â€‹A sample Text window lets you better see the look of your choices of color.

It offers up to 3 choices for foreground colors with AAA compliant contrast.
